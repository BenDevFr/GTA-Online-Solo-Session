# What is the purpose of “GTA Online Session” ?

"GTA Online Session" allows you to turn a GTA Online session into a solo session while keeping the possibility to make sales of your biker club business, Ceo etc.

# How does it work ?

Launching GTA-Solo-Session.vbs  run GTAOSS.bat who freezes the GTAV process and unfreezes it after 10 seconds.

In the game, you will see all the players disconnecting instantly.

Now you can make your sales etc. in peace.

**⚠️Be careful, players can join you though, you are in a public solo session, not in a private session or by invitation**


# Requirement

PsSuspend : *PsSuspend* is part of a growing kit of Sysinternals command-line tools that aid in the administration of local and remote systems named *PsTools* . ( Source : [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pssuspend) )

You can find it in the Tools folder or on the link above ⬆️

**You can delete the Clavier+ folder but you must keep the following files with this structure:**

```
GTA-Solo-Session.vbs
GTAOSS.bat
    |
    |--Tools
        |
        |--pssuspend.exe
        |--pssuspend64.exe

```

# How to use it ?

The first time, you need to run Tools/pssuspend64.exe to install it.

Then, just run GTA-Solo-Session.vbs .Personally, I use Clavier+ to run it with an hotkey .You can modify and use my preconfigured Clavier.ini and place it in " C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Clavier+\ ".
You can find Clavier+ [Here](https://github.com/guilryder/clavier-plus)
